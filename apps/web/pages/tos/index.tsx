        with the Site and the API, the &quot; Application&quot; ) that OneHash may offer from time to time,
        subject to this Terms of Service agreement (&quot; TOS&quot; ). By accepting this TOS or by accessing

        this TOS. If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company, business or other legal entity,
        you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to this TOS, in which
        case the terms &quot; you&quot; or &quot; your&quot; shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If
        you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you must not accept this TOS and
        may not use the Service. Any actions you, or any of your employees, consultants, agents,
        representatives, and users take on the Service shall be deemed to have occurred on behalf of your

        Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.

        to enter into this TOS. Some states do notallow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of
        liability forincidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the abovelimitations may
        not apply to you. In these states, OneHash’s Liability will belimited to the greatest extent permitted
        by law. 9. Indemnification You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless OneHash from and against any
